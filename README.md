DECIDE is an AI-orchestrated, real-time incident response system for complex operations.

When systems get stuck and context is fragmented across teams, DECIDE aggregates live signals and parallel conversations, continuously reassesses severity, and recommends the right escalation — while keeping a human operator in control.

Built as a realistic ops control surface, DECIDE shows how AI agents can coordinate context, surface what matters, and support fast, accountable decisions under pressure.
