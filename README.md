DECIDE is an AI-orchestrated, real-time incident response system for robotaxi operations and other complex, safety-critical environments.

When vehicles get stuck and context is fragmented across teams (fleet ops, rider support, field recovery, authorities), DECIDE aggregates live signals and parallel conversations, continuously reassesses severity, and recommends the right escalation — while keeping a human operator in control.

Built as a realistic ops control surface, DECIDE shows how AI agents can coordinate context, surface what matters, and support fast, accountable decisions under pressure.
